# Inline Movie Info for Google Movies

A [Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/instant-ratings-for-googl/ifbobeipgdgloiodkloakjehkjgpiphb) that adds movie info to showtimes displayed by Google search results, including IMDB rating, plot, year, and genre.

Note that movie information is obtained via the title, and therefore results may reflect previous movies with the same title (in which case the 'Year' will reflect the previous movie). Also, when using Google Instant Search, a page refresh may be required to load movie data.

Future plans include adding RottenTomatoes ratings as well. Enjoy, and let me know if you have suggestions!
